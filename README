Game menu built in ApkBuilder using Meizu 5mc android smartphone.

BGM is played in bound service with destruction cooldown to prevent GC on orientation change (current activity is recreated thus unbinding the last service client).

Preferences are stored in SharedPreferences and delivered to widgets and BGMService in realtime.
